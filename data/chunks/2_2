 was a fact that out of the five buses sold 586 by Balasubramania Pillai, only two were then running; the other three were under repairs.
The permanent permits for the sold buses were suspended by order of the Secretary dated 28th March, 1944.
Temporary permits for buses M.D.O. 920, 894, 918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482 had been issued to Veerappa Pillai during the same month.
Now we come to another chapter in the story.
Balasubra mania Pillai resiled from the joint application and repudi ated it as having been got from him by fraud.
The Secre tary, Road Traffic Board, thereupon refused to transfer the ownership on the 19th March, 1944, and this order was con firmed by the Board on 29th May, 1944, Balasubramania Pillai and Veerappa Pillai made a joint application on 10th April, 1944, for transfer of the buses and the original permits in favour of Veerappa Pillai who had on the same date agreed to purchase the vehicles.
The Secretary granted this applica tion on the same date Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., took the matter before the Central Road Traffic Board and they made an order on 16th August, 1944, upholding the issue of tempo rary permits to Veerappa Pillai for his buses M.D.O. 920, 894,918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482, but setting aside the trans fer of registry of the original buses and the transfer of the permits relating to the same.
On an application by Veerappa Pillai to review its order dated 16th August, 1944, the Central Road Traffic Board allowed on 27th November, 1944, only the transfer of the ownership of the buses but not a transfer of the permits.
Yet another move in the game was this Veerappa Pillai filed a suit in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Kumbako nam, on 3rd October, 1944, for recovery of possession of the original five buses from Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., on the strength of his purchase from Balasubramania Pillai.
The Subordinate Judge appointed Veerappa Pillai as Receiver on 17th March, 1945, and the five disputed buses were deliv ered to him on 26th April, 1945.
Two of the buses M.D.O. 6 and 7 were repaired by him and put on the route under his temporary permits.
The suit was decreed in 587 his favour on 2nd May, 1946.
Later, he repaired the other three buses M.D.O. 759, 230 and 81 and began to run them on the same route under the temporary permits he held.
Veerappa Pillai was discharged from receivership on 18th September, 1946.
On the strength of the Sub Court decree, Veerappa Pillai again applied for a permanent transfer of the permits, and on 22nd July, 1946, the Central Road Traffic Board trans ferred the petition to the Regional Transport Authority with an intimation that it saw no objection to the issue of regular permits to Veerappa Pillai for the disputed buses or to their transfer in his name, provided there were valid permits in existence.
This view appears to have been modi fied later and on 2nd September, 1946, the Regional Trans port Officer directed the issue of temporary permits to the buses for the period from 3rd September,
