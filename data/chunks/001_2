(1) Sections 127 to 131 shall apply with any necessary adaptations in relation to the conversion of securities as they apply in relation to a reorganisation (that is to say, a reorganisation or reduction of a companys share capital). (3) For the purposes of this section and section 133 (a) conversion of securities includes any of the following, whether effected by a transaction or occurring in consequence of the operation of the terms of any security or of any debenture which is not a security, that is to say a conversion of securities of a company (i) into shares in the company, and (ia) a conversion of a security which is not a qualifying corporate bond into a security of the same company which is such a bond, and (ib) a conversion of a qualifying corporate bond into a security which is a security of the same company but is not such a bond, and (ii) a conversion at the option of the holder of the securities converted as an alternative to the redemption of those securities for cash, and (iii) any exchange of securities effected in pursuance of any enactment (including an enactment passed after this Act) which provides for the compulsory acquisition of any shares or securities and the issue of securities or other securities instead, (b) security includes any loan stock or similar security whether of the Government of the United Kingdom or of any other government, or of any public or local authority in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or of any company, and whether secured or unsecured.
The purpose of TCGA, sections 127 to 131, referred to in the opening line of section 132, is to provide that there is no disposal of shares at the time of the reorganisation, and for further matters, such as the allocation of the consideration between different classes of security, part disposals, unpaid calls and indexation.
The key points to note in these provisions, which it is not necessary to set out, are (1) that a conversion as defined is to receive the same relief as a reorganisation, ie rollover relief, even if it involves QCBs whose disposal is otherwise outside the charge to CGT; and (2) that emphasis is given to the aggregation of the securities into a single asset: section 127 provides that both the original holding, taken as a single asset, which the holder disposes of under the reorganisation, and the consideration securities, also taken as a single asset, are treated as the same asset with the same acquisition date as the original holding.
We are not concerned with sections 133 or 134.
To ensure that the conversion of, or into, QCBs on a reorganisation is within the charge to CGT on the same basis as the issue of other securities on a reorganisation, ie on the basis that the holder is entitled to rollover relief, section 116(1) provides that the disposal will result in rollover relief where sections 127 to 130 would apply, and (these are the critical words which this court must construe): (b) [Limb A] either the original shares would consist of or include a qualifying corporate bond and the new holding would not, or [Limb B] the original shares would not and the new holding would consist of or include such a bond; (words in square brackets added)
Floyd LJ, giving the first judgment in the Court of Appeal, called the first possible scenario in section 116(1)(b), Limb A, and the alternative scenario, Limb B. I will do the same.
The effect of section 116(1)(b) is that, where the new holding following conversion includes QCBs, Limb A cannot apply.
The question here is whether Limb B applies: the appellants
