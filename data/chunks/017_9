formerly article 299(4) EC).
He then continued (at para 48): As a result of that specialised provision, the Treaty rules do not apply fully but apply only in part to Jersey, within the limits laid down by the specific regime created for it.
In this respect, the general legal situation regarding Jersey is identical to that of the Isle of Man. 49.
Now, and this is the crux of the matter: Jersey Produce Marketing Organisation was about the Treaty provisions on the free movement of goods.
Contrary to the situation in Barr and Montrose Holdings, no rules of the specific regime applied to the Channel Islands.
Consequently the court held that for the purpose of the application of [articles 28, 30, 34 and 35 TFEU,] the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom must be treated as one member state. 50.
Nothing else can or should, in my view, be said of the situation of the UK and Gibraltar when it comes to the freedom of provision of services under article 56 TFEU.
The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice agreed with the conclusion of Advocate General Szpunar.
It held that the provision of services by operators established in Gibraltar to persons established in the United Kingdom constitutes, as a matter of EU law, a situation confined in all respects within a single member state.
Its reasoning appears at paras 35 43 which need to be set out in full. 35.
It is true that the court has previously held, as observed by all the interested parties, that Gibraltar does not form part of the United Kingdom (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom (Case C 30/01) [EU:C:2003:489], para 47, and 12 September 2006, Spain v United Kingdom [(Case C 145/04) EU:C:2006:543], para 15). 36.
That fact is not, however, decisive in determining whether two territories must, for the purposes of the applicability of the provisions on the four freedoms, be treated as a single member state.
Indeed, the court has previously held, in para 54 of the judgment of 8 November 2005, Jersey Produce Marketing Organisation , that, for the purposes of the application of articles 23, 25, 28 and 29 EC, the Channel Islands, of which the Bailiwick of Jersey forms part, the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom must be treated as a single member state, notwithstanding the fact that those islands do not form part of the United Kingdom. 37.
In reaching that conclusion, the court, after observing that the United Kingdom is responsible for the Bailiwick of Jerseys external relations, relied in particular on the fact that, according to article 1(1) of Protocol No 3 on the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man annexed to the 1972 Act of Accession, EU rules on customs matters and quantitative restrictions are to apply to the Channel Islands and to the Isle of Man under the same conditions as they apply to the United Kingdom, and on the fact that no aspect of the status of those islands suggests that relations between the islands and the United Kingdom are akin to those between member states (see, in that regard, judgment of 8 November 2005, Jersey Produce Marketing Organisation, , paras 43, 45 and 46). 38.
As regards, in the first place, the conditions under which article 56 TFEU is to apply to Gibraltar, it is true that article 355(3) TFEU does not state that article 56 is to apply to Gibraltar under the same conditions as they apply to the
