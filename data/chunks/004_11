 payment was made in error because full checks had yet to be completed in relation to the loss relief claim.
The legal effect of these entries is a matter of dispute.
In the first place the Revenue do not accept that the personal tax computation is properly to be characterised as generated by the 2010 Return (in Henderson LJs words).
They accept that Mr Derry self assessed his own tax liability for 2009/10, but their position is that his self assessed liability was in the sum of (plus) 95,546.36, given in Box 1 on page TC1, not the figure after taking account of loss relief.
The reference to the loss relief claim was to be treated as additional information in respect of a free standing credit or FSC (a non statutory term: see Upper Tribunal para 61), but not as directly relevant to his liability for the year 2009/10.
The judgments below
On this issue there was a difference between the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.
Morgan J agreed with the Revenues interpretation: I consider that the tax return should be construed against the background of the relevant legal provisions.
Under Chapter 6 of Part 4 of ITA, Mr Derry is able to make a claim in relation to such capital losses against the income in the year 2010 2011 and also the year 2009 2010 but such a claim relates to the year 2010 2011 and does not reduce the tax payable for the year 2009 2010.
Against that background, I consider that the presence of the claim for capital losses does not displace the clear assessment to tax in the sum of 95,546.36. (UT para 52)
Henderson LJ disagreed with this reasoning (CA para 60).
It failed to recognise the distinction between the claim itself, which could only be given effect in 2010/11, and the self assessment which Mr Derry performed, albeit on an erroneous basis, for 2009/10; and also failed to give effect to the adjustment made and explained in Boxes 15 and 16 on page TC2.
Further it was inconsistent with parts of Lord Hodges reasoning in Cotter.
He also rejected as an impossible contention the submission for HMRC that the entry in Box 15 should not be construed as forming part of the calculation of liability to tax for 2009/10: The purpose of the tax calculation is to calculate the tax due for the year of assessment.
The rubric above boxes 13 to 15 refers to the need to make an adjustment to increase or decrease your tax for 2009 10, because of claims (inter alia) to carry back to 2009/10 certain losses from 2010/11.
In this context, although the wording of Box 15 itself (Any 2010 11 repayment you are claiming now) is on any view rather imprecise, it can only sensibly be understood as referring to a carry back of losses from 2010/11 in reduction of the tax actually due for 2009/10.
This is what Mr Derry purported to do, and this was the basis on which he calculated the repayment of tax due to him (para 63)
Cotter
At this stage it is necessary to refer in more detail to the leading judgment of Lord Hodge in Cotter itself.
Mr Cotter had claimed to carry back to the previous year (2007/08) loss relief allegedly sustained in 2008/09.
He had originally submitted his return for 2007/08 without a claim for loss relief and had left it to the Revenue to calculate the tax due.
That had led to a calculation of his tax liability
