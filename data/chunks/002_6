, which Sales LJ had himself quoted in para 31 of his judgment, guides the expert towards the type of evaluation which is important in assessing the torture story.
Paragraph 105 of the protocol recommends that, in formulating a clinical impression for the purpose of reporting evidence of torture, experts should ask themselves six questions, including whether their findings are consistent with the alleged report of torture and whether the clinical picture suggests a false allegation of torture.
Paragraph 122 says: The purpose of the written or oral testimony of the physician is to provide expert opinion on the degree to which medical
findings correlate with the patients allegations of abuse
In another case of alleged torture, namely SA (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1302; [2007] Imm AR 1 236, the Court of Appeal, by the judgment of Sir Mark Potter, President of the Family Division, held in paras 27 and 28 that the task for which an asylum seeker tendered a medical report was to provide a clear statement as to the consistency of old scars found with the history given , directed to the particular injuries said to have occurred as a result of the torture or other ill treatment relied on as evidence of persecution.
In paras 29 and 30 Sir Mark quoted paras 186 and 187 of the Istanbul Protocol and commended them as particularly instructive for those requested to supply medical reports in relation to alleged torture.
In RT (medical reports causation of scarring) Sri Lanka [2008] UKAIT 00009 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in para 37 described the SA (Somalia) case as a landmark authority in the identification of the purpose of a medical report in relation to alleged torture and in the indorsement of the Istanbul Protocol.
It is no surprise that the European Court of Human Rights should have adopted a similar construction of the role of the expert in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol: in Mehmet Eren v Turkey (2008) (Application No 32347/02), it relied in para 43 upon the conclusion of a medical report about the consistency of the clinical findings with the applicants account of serious ill treatment while he was in police custody.
Again, no surprise that, in para 3.2 of its Guidelines on the Judicial Approach to Expert Medical Evidence dated June 2010, the International Association of Refugee Law Judges should have recognised the function of the report as being to provide expert opinion on the degree of correlation between the asylum seekers presentation and his allegations of torture.
And indeed, no surprise that, in para 3.3 of his instruction to case workers entitled Medico Legal Reports from the Helen Bamber Foundation and the Medical Foundation Medico Legal Report Service dated July 2015, the Home Secretary should have required them to give due consideration to medical opinions given on behalf of those organisations upon the degree of consistency between the clinical findings and the account of torture.
The reader will have noticed that, in making the erroneous observations quoted in para 19 above, Sales LJ added in para 35 that the primary source of guidance for experts in such circumstances should be the Tribunal Rules and the Practice Direction rather than the Istanbul Protocol.
This was a point to which he returned in para 94, as follows: Contrary to what some of the expert witnesses in this case seem to have thought, it is the Practice Direction, not the Istanbul Protocol, which provides the relevant authoritative guidance as to their duty, helpful though parts of the Istanbul Protocol might be as a reference resource.
Sales LJ was there referring to Practice Direction 10 in Part 4 of the Practice Directions of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal, dated 10 February 2010 and amended on 13 November 2014.
