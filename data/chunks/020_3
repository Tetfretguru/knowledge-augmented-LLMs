 Court of Protection, and questions relating to the care and welfare of such adults were resolved under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.
The MCA 2005 established a new regime with, amongst other things, a new Court of Protection which has jurisdiction in relation to both property matters and issues relating to personal care.
Nevertheless, an examination of the common law in relation to the treatment of patients such as Mr Y must commence with the pre MCA 2005 cases, and I turn first to two centrally important House of Lords decisions, In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1 and Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993] AC 789.
In In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation), the House of Lords considered whether the court had jurisdiction to grant a declaration that it would not be unlawful for a sterilisation operation to be carried out on a woman who, because of mental incapacity, was unable to consent to the operation herself.
Although not concerned with precisely the sort of life and death decision that is involved in the present litigation, the decision is relevant because their Lordships were required to determine a sensitive and difficult question relating to medical treatment of a mentally incapacitated adult.
They determined that the court could, under its inherent jurisdiction, make a declaration that the proposed operation was in the patients best interests and therefore lawful.
They also held that where the procedure was intended to prevent pregnancy rather than for the purpose of treating a disease, although not necessary to establish the lawfulness of the operation, it was highly desirable, as a matter of good practice, that a declaration be obtained before the operation took place.
The starting point for the reasoning was the established common law position that a doctor cannot lawfully operate on adult patients of sound mind, or give them any other treatment involving the application of physical force without their consent, and if he were to do so, he would commit the tort of trespass to the person (p 55), but that, in the case of a patient who lacked the capacity to consent to treatment, a doctor could lawfully operate or give other treatment provided that it was in the best interests of the patient.
There was a range of views as to whether, with an operation such as the proposed sterilisation operation, it was desirable/necessary to obtain a declaration from the court that the procedure was in the patients best interests.
All were in favour of a declaration being obtained but, for the most part, put the matter on the basis of good practice, rather than finding it to be a legal requirement that such a declaration first be obtained.
There was fairly general agreement with the approach of Lord Brandon of Oakbrook.
At p 56, he identified six special features of the particular operation which were influential in his view that, whilst the lawfulness of the treatment did not depend upon the courts approval and it was not therefore strictly necessary as a matter of law to seek it, the involvement of the court was highly desirable as a matter of good practice.
The six features were: first, the operation will in most cases be irreversible; secondly, by reason of the general irreversibility of the operation, the almost certain result of it will be to deprive the woman concerned of what is widely, and as I think rightly, regarded as one of the fundamental rights of a woman, namely, the right to bear children; thirdly, the deprivation of that right gives rise to moral and emotional considerations to which many people attach great importance; fourthly, if the question whether the operation is in the best interests of the woman is left to be decided without the involvement of the court, there may be a greater risk of it being decided wrongly, or at least of it being thought to have been decided wrongly; fifthly
