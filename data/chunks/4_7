 evidence is that she enjoyed it so long as she was alive.
No difficulty also arises regarding the payment of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu as has been stated by the High Court in its judgment.
Having regard to the meticulous care with which the testator seems to have attempted to provide for the differ ent contingencies that might arise and the anxiety displayed by him in making an effective disposition of all the proper ties he owned, it is not probable that he would omit to make any provision regarding the future devolution of the Kothan gudi village if he really thought that such direction had to be repeated in the latter part of the will.
The omission of the gift of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu also cannot be explained on any other hypothesis.
It is not necessary for the purpose of the present case to invoke any rule of presumption against.
intestacy, but if the presumption exists at all, it certainly fortifies the conclusion which we have arrived at.
The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the of the High Court are set aside and those of the Subordinate Judge restored.
The appellant will have costs of all the courts.
Appeal allowed.
