 to apply the correct legal test or if he reaches a decision which is irrational or has no sufficient evidential basis.
The High Court does occasionally hear oral evidence and make mandatory orders, and has power to award compensation for breaches of the rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
However, contrary to what was said in the notice quoted in para 3 above, judicial review is not an appeal on the merits of the decision.
The main reason advanced by the FSA why the section 9 procedure is not also applicable is that such a procedure, operated in the way the claimant appellants say that it can be operated, in effect as an appeal against the merits of the OVs decision, would be incompatible with the regime contained in the suite of EU food safety Regulations which came into force in the United Kingdom in 2006.
Hence, the second issue is whether use of the procedure in section 9 of the 1990 Act is compatible with the food safety regime laid down by European Union law, specifically by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs; Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin; Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption; Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules; and Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 on health rules as regards animal by products.
Also relevant is the prior Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law.
The third issue is whether Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 mandates an appeal procedure and if so whether such an appeal should be capable of challenging the OVs decision on the full factual merits or whether the more limited scope of challenge involved in judicial review of the OVs decision and of a disposal notice as referred to above is sufficient to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
Relevant European Union Law
Under article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, food means any substance or product intended to be, or reasonably expected to be ingested by humans.
It is common ground between the parties that carcass 77 was food when it was slaughtered and remained so after the OV formed the opinion that it was unfit for human consumption and declared it as such.
Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides that food shall not be placed on the market if it is unsafe.
Food is deemed unsafe if it is considered to be (a) injurious to health, (b) unfit for human consumption.
Article 5.1 of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 provides that food business operators (FBOs) such as slaughterhouses shall not place on the market a product of animal origin unless it has a health mark applied in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 (or an identification mark if a health mark is not required by the latter Regulation).
Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 lays down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin (article 1.1).
The application of the official controls which it requires is without prejudice to the primary legal responsibility of FBOs to ensure food safety under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (article 1.3).
The controls are of several types.
Article 4, for example, deals with official controls to verify an FBOs general compliance with the Regulations, including detailed audits of good
