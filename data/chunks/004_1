This appeal concerns the correct treatment for income tax purposes of the respondents (Mr Derrys) claim for share loss relief under section 132 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA).
The claimed loss arose in this way.
On 22 March 2010 (tax year 2009/10) Mr Derry bought 500,000 shares, at a cost of 500,000, in a company called Media Pro Four Ltd. On 4 November 2010 (tax year 2010/11) he sold them to the Island House Private Charitable Trust for 85,500, thereby realising a capital loss of 414,500.
In his return for 2009/10, submitted by his accountants on 24 January 2011, he claimed share loss relief for that amount against his income for that year under ITA section 132, with the aim of reducing to that extent his taxable income for that year.
The appellant (the Revenue) has identified the claim as a case of possible tax avoidance, but whether that is so is not an issue presently before us.
The appeal raises two questions.
The first relates to the effect in law of such a claim to set the relief against the income for the previous year (the loss relief issue).
The second relates to the effect of the inclusion of such a claim (even if erroneous) within Mr Derrys return for the previous year, in circumstances where the Revenue have failed to institute a timeous enquiry into the return under Taxes Management Act 1970 as amended (TMA) section 9A (the tax return issue).
The first is an issue of pure statutory interpretation, depending on the interaction of the certain provisions of the ITA and of the TMA.
The second raises issues as to the correct understanding and effect of Mr Derrys return, in the light of the law and practice relating to the self assessment regime, having regard in particular to the guidance given by this court in Revenue and Customs Comrs v Cotter [2013] UKSC 69; [2013] 1 WLR 3514 (Cotter).
The procedural background is as follows.
In December 2011, Mr Derrys accountants submitted his tax return for 2010/11 online, which (consistently with the position as stated in his 2009/10 return) said of the loss of 414,500: This loss relief has already been claimed and relief obtained in 2009/10.
Nothing turns on the detail of this return.
The Revenue responded by three steps: i) On 4 January 2012, the Revenue gave notice of their intention to open an enquiry into the claim for share loss relief for 2009/10.
This notice was issued under TMA Schedule lA, on the footing that the claim had been made outside of a return by virtue of paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 1B.
That enquiry remains open.
However, if, as Mr Derry submits, Schedule 1B had no application and the claim was properly made within the return for 2009/10, then (as is common ground) the enquiry under Schedule 1A had no statutory basis. ii) On 16 February 2012, the Revenue gave notice of their intention to open an enquiry under TMA section 9A into the return for 2010/11.
The accompanying letter indicated that it would be necessary to look at all the arrangements surrounding the claim, an area of concern being that the claimed losses might have arisen from a marketed scheme of arrangements with the purpose of avoiding tax.
That enquiry also remains open. iii) On 21 February 2014, the Revenue issued a demand under TMA section 60
