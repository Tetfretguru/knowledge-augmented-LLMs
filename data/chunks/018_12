 jurisdiction for cases, which are exhaustively listed, in which the defendant may or must, depending on the case, be sued in the courts of another member state: the Reisch Montage case, para 22 and Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), Anstalt des ffentlichen Rechts v JP Morgan Chase Bank NA (Case C 144/10) EU:C:2011:300; [2011] 1 WLR 2087; [2011] ECR I 3961, para 30. 27.
Those rules of special and exclusive jurisdiction must accordingly be interpreted strictly.
As the provisions of article 22 of Regulation No 44/2001 introduce an exception to the general rule governing the attribution of jurisdiction, they must not be given an interpretation broader than that which is required by their objective: Hassetts case, paras 18 and 19 and the BVG case, para 30. 28.
As regards the objectives and the purpose of Regulation No 44/2001, it should be recalled that, as is apparent from recitals (2) and (11) thereof [which correspond with recitals (4) and (15) of the Recast Regulation], that Regulation seeks to unify the rules on conflict of jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters by way of rules of jurisdiction which are highly predictable.
That Regulation thus pursues an objective of legal certainty which consists in strengthening the legal protection of persons established in the European Union, by enabling the applicant easily to identify the court in which he may sue and the defendant reasonably to foresee before which court he may be sued: Falco Privatstiftung v Weller Lindhorst (Case C 533/07) EU:C:2009:257; [2010] Bus LR 210; [2009] ECR I 3327, paras 21 22, Taser International Inc v SC Gate 4 Business SRL (Case C 175/15) EU:C:2016:176; [2016] QB 887, para 32 and Granarolo SpA v Ambrosi Emmi France SA (Case C 196/15) EU:C:2016:559; [2017] CEC 473, para 16. 29.
Furthermore, as is apparent from recital (12) of that Regulation [which corresponds with recital (16) of the Recast Regulation], the rules of jurisdiction derogating from the general rule of jurisdiction of the courts of the member state in which the defendant is domiciled supplement the general rule where there is a close link between the court designated by those rules and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice. 30.
In particular, the rules of exclusive jurisdiction laid down in article 22 of Regulation No 44/2001 seek to ensure that jurisdiction rests with courts closely linked to the proceedings in fact and law (see, with regard to article 16 of the Convention of 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (OJ 1972 L299, p 32), the provisions of which are essentially identical to those of article 22 of Regulation No 44/2001, Gesellschaft fur Antriebstechnik mbH & Co KG (GAT) v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG (Case C 4/03) EU:C:2006:457; [2006] ECR I 6509; [2007] ILPr 34, para 21), in other words, to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the courts of a member state in specific circumstances where, having regard to the matter
