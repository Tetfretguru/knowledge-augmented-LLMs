 careful delimitation by Parliament of its capacity to institute or intervene in proceedings where and only where a specific unlawful act is in question under sections 6 and 7.
It is wrong to approach the present issue on the basis of an assumption that it would be anomalous if the Commission did not have the (apparently unlimited) capacity suggested to bring proceedings to establish the interpretation, or incompatibility with Convention rights, of any primary Westminster legislation it saw as requiring this for the better protection of human rights.
The issue is one of statutory construction, not a priori preconception.
It is in fact no surprise, in my view, that Parliament did not provide for the Commission to have capacity to pursue what would amount to an unconstrained actio popularis, or right to bring abstract proceedings, in relation to the interpretation of United Kingdom primary legislation in some way affecting Northern Ireland or its supposed incompatibility with any Convention right.
On the contrary, it is natural that Parliament should have left it to claimants with a direct interest in establishing the interpretation or incompatibility of primary legislation to initiate proceedings to do so; and should have limited the Commissions role to giving assistance under sections 69(5)(a) and 70 and to instituting or intervening in proceedings involving an actual or potential victim of an unlawful act as defined in section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
True it is that sections 3 and 4 of the HRA are not made expressly subject to the victimhood requirement which affects sections 6 and 7: R (Rusbridger) v Attorney General [2004] 1 AC 357, para 21, per Lord Steyn; though they must undoubtedly be subject to the usual rules regarding standing in public law proceedings.
However, a capacity to commence general proceedings to establish the interpretation or incompatibility of primary legislation is a much more far reaching power than one to take steps as or in aid of an actual or potential victim of an identifiable unlawful act.
Further, Parliaments natural understanding would have reflected what has been and is the general or normal position in practice, namely that sections 3 and 4 would be and are resorted to in aid of or as a last resort by a person pursuing a claim or defence under sections 7 and 8: see Lancashire County Council v Taylor [2005] EWCA Civ 284; [2005] 1 WLR 2668, para 28, reciting counsels submission, and paras 37 44, concluding that, to exercise the courts discretion to grant a declaration to someone who had not been and could not be personally adversely affected would be to ignore section 7.
This being the normal position, it is easy to understand why there is nothing in section 71 to confer (the apparently unlimited) capacity which the Commission now suggests that it has to pursue general proceedings to establish the interpretation or incompatibility of primary legislation under sections 3 and/or 4 of the HRA, in circumstances when its capacity in the less fundamental context of an unlawful act under sections 6 and 7 is expressly and carefully restricted.
In instructive written submissions by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) for England and Wales and Scotland as intervener, the EHRC invites comparison with the legislation which governs it, and suggests that it would be incongruous if there were a distinction between the position in England, Wales and Scotland on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the other.
Sections 9 and 30 of the Equality Act 2006 provide as follows in relation to the EHRC: 9(1) Human rights The Commission shall, by exercising the powers conferred by this Part encourage good practice in relation to human (a) promote understanding of
