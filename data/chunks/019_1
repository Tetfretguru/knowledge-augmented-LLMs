On 12 May 2008, Mr Karel Konecny (the appellant), a Czech national, was convicted in his absence by the District Court in Brno Venkov, Czech Republic (the District Court) of three offences of fraud, committed between November 2004 and March 2005, and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment.
It was alleged that the three offences concerned a total sum of approximately 120,000.
The extradition of the appellant has been requested by the District Court by a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) dated 17 April 2013 pursuant to the European Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the Surrender Procedures between member states (2002/584/JHA) (the Framework Decision).
The Czech Republic is a designated Category 1 territory pursuant to section 1 of the Extradition Act 2003 (the 2003 Act), by the Extradition Act 2003 (Designation of Part 1 Territories) Order 2003 (SI 2003/3333), as amended by the Extradition Act 2003 (Amendment to Designations) Order 2004 (SI 2004/1898).
Part 1 of the 2003 Act, as amended, applies in this case.
The EAW states that it is based on an enforceable judgment, namely the judgment of the District Court dated 12 May 2008, confirmed by the resolution of the Regional Court in Brno dated 23 July 2008.
The EAW specifies that the appellant will be afforded an unqualified right to be re tried upon return in the event that he makes an application to be re tried.
A letter from the District Court dated 17 March 2017 confirms that: (1) The appellant was never arrested in connection with the offences; (2) He was never questioned in connection with the offences; (3) He was never informed that he had been sought for questioning; and (4) He was never subject to a restriction from leaving the Czech Republic.
The EAW was submitted to, and received by, the National Crime Agency (NCA), an authority designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of Part 1 of the 2003 Act.
On 2 March 2017 the EAW was certified by the NCA under sections 2(7) and (8) of the 2003 Act.
The appellant was arrested pursuant to section 3 of the 2003 Act on 2 March 2017.
The initial hearing took place at Westminster Magistrates Court pursuant to section 4 of the 2003 Act.
The appellant was remanded in custody to the extradition hearing.
The extradition hearing took place before District Judge Ashworth at Westminster Magistrates Court on 10 April 2017.
One of the issues raised was whether, under section 14 of the 2003 Act, extradition would be oppressive or unjust given the passage of time since the offences.
In reliance on section 14(a) of the 2003 Act, the appellant argued that he was an accused person facing a prospective trial and that it would be unjust and oppressive to order his extradition taking into account the delay since 2004 and events and changes in his personal circumstances within that period.
The appellant also maintained that his extradition would infringe his rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
In his judgment dated 24 April 2017 District Judge Ashworth ruled that it was the conviction provisions in section 14(b) which were the operative provisions and that, as a result, the passage of time to be considered under section 11(1)(c) and section 14 was restricted to the period from
