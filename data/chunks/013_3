84, made up of: i) housing benefit (548.51) ii) income support (290.33); iii) child tax credit (819.00); iv) child benefit (240.00).
Excluding housing benefit, therefore, the total available for other living expenses was 1,349.33.
On the expenses side, her rent was 700 per month, leaving a shortfall compared to her housing benefit taken alone of 151.49.
Her estimates of her non housing expenses had varied in the course of her exchanges with the council.
Her initial estimate had been only 380 per month (including 150 food/household items).
By the time of the review decision, a revised schedule had been submitted by her solicitors on 1 November 2013, giving a total estimate of 1,234.99, consisting of: i) 750 food/household items; ii) 80 electricity; iii) 100 gas; iv) 50 clothes; v) 43.33 TV licence; vi) 43.33 school meals; vii) 108.33 travel; viii) 20 telephone; ix) 40 daughters gymnastics.
No supporting information was provided.
The accompanying letter said: It is impossible for our client, who as you are aware has learning difficulties to remember precise details, we are confident that these figures are reasonably accurate.
It will be seen that, on an overall view (including housing benefit and rent), her monthly income amounted to 1,897.84 entirely from benefits, and her expenses amounted to 1,934.99, giving a shortfall of about 37 per month.
According to the authoritys inquiries of her landlords, she also had arrears of rent of 1,600, although she claimed it was only one months rent (700).
This difference was left unresolved by the judge (para 23).
Although these figures were accepted as common ground in the lower courts, Ms Garnham for the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) has pointed to some apparent discrepancies in respect of benefits.
She explains in her witness statement of 11 January 2019, para 68: I note that in para 11 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal the appellant gives her income at the relevant time as child tax credits of 189 a week (ie 819 a month), income support of 67 a week (ie 290.33 a month) and child benefit of 240 a month.
The correct amount of child tax credits would in fact be 206.15 a week.
Assuming the figures given by the appellant are correct, it is likely that the tax credit award was in fact being paid at a lower rate to recover a previous overpayment.
The other figures given for income support are out by 0.50 per week (so monthly should be 292.50) and for child benefit the figure given is a four weekly figure rather than the calendar month figure of 262.16.
I record this evidence for completeness and in case the differences may become material hereafter.
However, it is not directly relevant to the appeal, which is in principle limited to points of law arising from the original decision of the council, and taking into account the information then before it.
The councils decision
The councils final position on affordability in the present case appears from their review decision letter dated 11 December 2013.
The letter, written by the case officer, was long and detailed, and dealt with other issues which are no longer in dispute.
It began by referring in general terms to various sources considered, including the Code of Guidance (see para 6 above), but there was no specific reference to the paragraphs dealing with affordability.
The officer first addressed, and rejected, a suggestion
