Consistently with that concession, if (as I have decided) Mr Derry succeeds on Issue 1, then the claim properly formed part of Mr Derrys return for the year 2009/10, and that it could only be challenged by a notice served within time under TMA section 9A.
However, the second issue is of some difficulty and of general importance.
It may be helpful therefore for us to express some views on the respective submissions.
This issue has to be approached on the assumption that Mr Derry was wrong on the first issue, and that the inclusion of the loss relief claim in the assessment of his liability for 2009/10 was in error.
Before further considering this issue, it is necessary to refer in more detail to the factual background.
The sequence of events
On 24 January 2011 Mr Derrys accountants filed his 2009/10 self assessment tax return (the 2010 return).
The Additional Information pages (Ai3 and Ai4) were completed as follows.
In Boxes 3 and 4 (headed Trading Losses) he put 414,500.00 as the amount for which he was claiming relief, and 2009/10 as the tax year for which it was claimed.
Box 19 (which was a blank space for additional information) contained the following entry: Box 3 of page Ai3 shows capital losses realised on disposal of subscriber shares in an unlisted trading company in year ended 5 April 2011.
These losses have been carried back to year ended 5 April 2010 and relief claimed under section 131, section 132 ITA 2007.
He also calculated his own tax and completed the tax calculation summary pages (pages TC1 and 2) in the 2009 10 return as follows.
On page TCl (headed self assessment), in Box 1 (total tax due before any payments on account), the figure of 95,546.36 appeared automatically as a result of entries made elsewhere on the form.
Page TC2 (headed adjustments to tax due) stated You may need to make an adjustment to increase or decrease your tax for 2009 10 because you are . carrying back to 2009 10 certain losses from 2010 11 .
In Box 15 (Any 2010/11 repayment you are claiming now) Mr Derry inserted the figure of 165,800; and in Box 16 (Any other information) the words: The reduction in tax payable in Box 15 of page TC2 relates to the loss carry back claim arising from the carry back of losses of GBP 414,500 as set out on page Ai3.
The corresponding reduction in tax payable in the year ended 5 April 2010 following this loss carry back claim is GBP 165, 800 being GBP 414,500 at 40%.
Mr Derry had already suffered tax deducted at source of 102,233.64 on his income for 2009/10 (made up principally of employment income of 497,120).
What followed was described by Henderson LJ: 10. the effect of his claim for loss relief carried back from 2010/11 was to generate a significant repayment of tax due to him.
This was quantified in his personal tax computation, generated by the 2010 Return, as a refund due to him of 70,253.64. 11.
On 18 October 2011, HMRC repaid a sum of 70,487.90 to Mr Derry.
It is unclear why HMRC refunded this slightly higher amount, but the payment was clearly intended to include the amount claimed by Mr Derry, albeit HMRC now say that the
