 for in Chapters 2 to 9 shall apply without prejudice to other Community provisions and in accordance with conditions which the member states shall lay down for the purposes of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of those exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse.
Chapter 2 of Title IX contains Exemptions for certain activities in the public interest.
Article 132(1)(i) of this Chapter says that member states shall exempt: the provision of childrens or young peoples education, school or university education, vocational training or retraining, including the supply of services and of goods closely related thereto, by bodies governed by public law having such as their aim or by other organisations recognised by the member state concerned as having similar objects.
Article 133 contains examples of the conditions member states may impose when recognising other organisations having similar objects to those of public bodies.
It echoes article 13(2) of the Sixth Directive and reads, so far as relevant: Member states may make the granting to bodies other than those governed by public law of each exemption provided for in points (i) of article 132(1) subject in each individual case to one or more of the following conditions: (a) the bodies in question must not systematically aim to make a profit, and any surpluses nevertheless arising must not be distributed, but must be assigned to the continuance or improvement of the services supplied; (d) the exemptions must not be likely to cause distortion of competition to the disadvantage of commercial enterprises subject to VAT.
These provisions of the Principal VAT Directive and the general scheme of which they form a part were considered by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) in Minister Finansw v MDDP sp z oo Akademia Biznesu, sp komandytowa, (Case C 319/12) [2014] STC 699.
MDDP, a Polish undertaking, carried on the business of organising for profit specialised training courses and applied to the Polish Minister for Finance for confirmation that it was entitled to deduct input VAT levied on the goods and services it needed for its business.
The Minister refused to provide that confirmation and so MDDP issued proceedings in which it claimed that its activities should not be exempt from VAT but subject to it, and that Polish law, which provided that such activities were exempt, was incompatible with the Principal VAT Directive.
A reference by the Polish court to the CJEU asked, in substance, whether articles 132(1), and 133 of the Principal VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that educational services provided for commercial purposes not governed by public law were precluded from exemption from VAT.
In addressing that question, the CJEU explained (at paras 33 to 36) that articles 132(1)(i) and 133 do not preclude educational services provided for commercial purposes by bodies not governed by public law from being exempt from VAT; however, under article 132(1)(i), supplies of educational services are exempt only if they are provided by bodies governed by public law or by other organisations recognised by the member state concerned as having similar objects.
It followed that the exemption in issue, which applied generally to all supplies of educational services, whatever the aim pursued by the private organisations providing those services, was incompatible with article 132(1)(i).
The CJEU continued (at paras 37 to 38) that, in so far as article 132(1)(i) does not specify the conditions or procedures for defining those similar objects, it is for the national law of each member state to lay down rules, and that member states have a discretion in that respect; and it is for the national courts to examine whether member states, in imposing such conditions, have observed the limits of their discretion
