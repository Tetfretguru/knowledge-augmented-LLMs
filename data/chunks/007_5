 Convention pre supposes an application made in a destination State which is not the State of habitual residence, then the second general question becomes of importance.
It becomes important because deliberate acts aimed at integrating the child in the destination State may well be undertaken by the travelling parent once he has decided not to honour his obligation to return to the State of origin.
It will then matter whether such acts, or other manifestations of his decision, can themselves amount to wrongful retention.
If they can, then wrongful retention may occur before any change of habitual residence has been achieved and whilst the child is still habitually resident in the State of origin.
If they cannot, and wrongful retention cannot occur until the day of agreed return arrives, it may be too late for any application under the Abduction Convention, because the same acts which derive from and accompany the decision not to return may themselves have resulted in the child becoming habitually resident in the destination State.
The first general question: habitual residence
The first question is accordingly this: if by the time of the act relied on as wrongful removal or retention the child is habitually resident in the State where the application for return is made, is summary return under the Abduction Convention still available or not?
This question did not arise in either of the courts below, where everyone proceeded on the assumption that the answer was no.
It arose in the course of argument in this court, and we have had the benefit not only of some immediate oral submissions, but of considered post hearing written submissions from both parties and from the International Centre for Family Law, Policy and Practice as intervener.
The argument that summary return under the Abduction Convention remains available runs as follows: (a) there is no express statement in the Convention that the remedy of summary return is available only where at the time of the act relied on as wrongful the child either remains habitually resident in the State of origin or is not habitually resident in the requested State; (b) on the contrary, article 3 refers to habitual residence only in order to identify the proper law that is to say to identify the law which determines whether a given act is wrongful (because it is in breach of rights of custody) or not; (c) therefore, if the child starts by being habitually resident in State A, but has by the time of the act relied on as wrongful become habitually resident in State B, all that article 3 requires is that you look to the law of State B to decide whether the act was wrongful or not; that is so whether State B is the requested State, or some intermediate State where the child has become habitually resident before arriving in the requested State; (d) once it has been decided that the act constituted either wrongful removal or wrongful retention, the Convention takes the court to article 12, which requires an order for return, subject to the limited exceptions contained in that article and article 13; (e) moreover, it is noticeable that article 12, in providing for an order for return, does not specify that return must be to the state of the childs habitual residence; it could be to any State; this reinforces the conclusion that habitual residence does not govern the place where application for return may be made, but is only referred to in the Convention in order to provide which law is to determine wrongfulness.
Accordingly, it is said, on facts such as those of the present case, if the childs habitual residence is in England by the time of the act relied on as wrongful retention, that simply means that it becomes English law which decides whether the retention was wrongful.
If it is decided that it is wrongful, there can still be a return to Australia.
This may be a possible construction if one has regard simply to the wording of articles 3 and 12.
It is, however, not
