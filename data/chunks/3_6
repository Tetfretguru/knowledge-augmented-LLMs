ilous attack on the integrity and honesty of a judicial officer.
Specific instances have been given where the officer is alleged to have taken bribes or behaved with impropriety to the litigants who did not satisfy his dishonest demands.
If the allegations were true, obviously it would be to the benefit of the public to bring these matters into light.
But if they were false, they cannot but undermine the confidence of the public in the administration of justice and bring judiciary into disrepute.
The appel lant, though he took sole responsibility regarding the publication of the article, was not in a position to sub stantiate by evidence any of the allegations made therein.
He admitted that the statement was based on hearsay.
Ru mours may have reached him from various sources, but before he published the article it was incumbent upon him as a reasonable man to attempt to verify the informations he received and ascertain, as far as he could.
whether the facts were true or mere concocted lies.
He does not appear to have made any endeavour in this direction.
As the appel lant did not act with reasonable care and caution, he cannot be said to have acted (1) 435 bona fide, even if good faith can be held to be a defence at all in a proceeding for contempt.
What is more, he did not express any regret for what he had done either in the High Court or before us and his behaviour does not show the least trace of contrition.
In these circumstances, we think that the appeal cannot succeed and must be dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
